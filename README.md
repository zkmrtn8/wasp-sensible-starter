# Wasp Sensible Starter
A minimal starter kit for Wasp with TailwindCSS and ShadCN with some small changes (primarily theming and toasts).

Notes:
- ShadCN Chart is not included, but it can be added easily
- Sonner (toasts) are not included. `react-hot-toast` is used instead.

To create an app using this template run `npx wasp-sensible` and follow the prompts.
